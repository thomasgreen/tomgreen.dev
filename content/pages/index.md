Hey, I'm **Tom Green**. I'm a web developer from the north-east of the United Kingdom. I am currently working at **Visualsoft**.

I _occasionally_ write [blog posts](/posts) about web tech I find interesting. They normally cover interesting techniques that I use in my own applications, ways of improving your code base or weird and wacky things you can do with PHP.
