**Damn**. 2020. What a (good, bad) year.

This is my first time writing one of these "year in review" blog posts but I'd like to make this an annual tradition. It gives me an opportunity to reflect on the positives from this year and also look into next year, 2021.

## Prologue

Before I get started, I want to acknowledge the fact that there are lots of people who have had it rough this year. Nobody could have predicted this year to turn out the way it did.

Some might have guessed that certain things would happen but definitely not to *this* extent.

I also want to acknowledge that I am *very* lucky and fortunate to be in a good position mentally, financially and health wise.
